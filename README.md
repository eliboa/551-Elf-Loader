# 551-Elf-Loader
An ELF loader for 5.5.0 and 5.5.1 (maybe 5.4.0)...expect it to not work at all. It's just here because I don't want to merge to libwiiu.

# How to use
You really don't. It doesn't work, it's just here to be here. That's all. If somebody wants to fix it, go right ahead.
You have to get an external elf (which is in libwiiu, search it up.), and make a folder named "payload" and also name your PHP File (5.4.0 & 5.5.*) payload.php in order for this to work.
but the funny thing is, even if you set it up right, it still doesn't work. It should crash upon loading every single time.
However, this was just a futile attempt.

# Does it work in XXXX?
It doesnt' work on any console. on 5.5.1 it gets at least to line 198.
